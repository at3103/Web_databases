Bing Account Key:
	2OR+OyjGjnltNG8Nuc2Q8y2w5CYKtpgxYtem+wWzEgk

	This key is added in the file src/key/key.py
	If the key needs to be changed, the key value must be altered in src/key/key.py 

To run:
	python main.py <t_es> <t_ec> <host>

	where <t_es> : Specificity threshold
	<t_ec> : Coverage threshold
	<host> : URL of database

	Example: python main.py 0.7 12000 fifa.com 

Modules:

	main.py: 
		The main driver program. It takes care of user input/interaction, getting results from the search engine, classifying the database, creating document samples and creating content summary. 

	1) Algorithm (src.algorithm)

	qProber.py:
		Contains the implementation of the QProber algorithm [1]. 


	2) Helper Classes (src.classes)

	classification.py: 
		This class provides an entity which helps provide an abstraction of the information about the categories in the database, their relationships(hierarchy), their attributes like specificity, coverage, content summary, etc. 
		
	given.py: 
		Persists the threshold values for specificity and coverage, as given by the user arguments.


	3) Helper Functions (src.functions)

	add_qterms.py: 
		Extracts the query terms for each of the categories from the text file provided and save it to their respective objects.
	
	BingQuery.py: 
		Queries Bing with the corresponding link generated by appending site and query term
	
	displayPages.py:
		Displays the pages retrieved from Bing (top 4 for each query term)
	
	savetoFile.py:
		Saving the content summary to a file according to the convention provided.
	
	check_sanity.py:
		Performs the sanity checks on the user inputs.


	4) Global variables and schema (src.glob)
	
	scheme.py: 
		Initializes all the catgeories and their relationships and some global variables.
	

	5) Authentication (src.key)

	key.py:
		This stores the Bing key as the variable key.

	
	6) Feed Data (src.queries)

	*.txt:
		Files containing the queries obtained from a SVM classifier of the QProber.

	
	Convert a html document:

	getWordsLynx.java
		This script converts an HTML document to lowercase, treats any character not in the English alphabet as a word separator, and  then returns the set of  words that appear in the document.
